			    <h3>smallbit framework</h3>
			    <hr/>
			    
				<p>
					This framework, was created to be as simple as possible.
					There is two main dependencies which are:
				</p>
						        
				<ol>
					<li>smarty-php</li>
					<li>php-activerecord</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>
					All you need to do when using this framework is to create a Controller class, a View (tpl file) and a Model if needed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The view is created using smarty templating way with pure HTML and javascript.
					The model must be created using php-activerecord.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Why creating another framework?</h4>
				<p>
					smallbit was created when I was building a webapp called <a href="http://www.arrumetudo.com.br">arrumetudo</a>.
					
					when creating this application, I didn't want to start learning some framework dealing with the whole learning curve.
					I needed to create my app as soon as possible and I'd like to use only my php knowledge to start working.
					This is the main purpose of this framework.
					But there is some small frameworks inside it!
					Ok, I know it, but smarty and php-activerecord are so natural to learn. You don't need to read lots of documents to start using it.
					Start writting and learning about them as you need.
